      <h1>TRAFFIC CRASHES CHICAGO</h1>

      <h2>About Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset that we have taken is <span>Traffic Crashes - Crashes</span>. Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Created on October 19, 2017 and is updated daily. For our visualization and analysis, we have taken a subset of this data from January 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2021 i.e two years. The interactive tool that we have used is D3.js and is executed in Observable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have taken two years of data from January 1st, 2020 - December 31st, 2021. There were a total of 198692 Crashes after prepocessing like removing null values. Our main analysis was to identify the crashes variation over different seasons in two years. As a result, we have added a new column called seasons.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Domain Question</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>How have the seasonal conditions impacted the traffic crashes?</h3>
      
      <p>Our intention is to identify any significant trends by analyzing crashes based on Lighting and Weather conditions over different seasons.</p>
